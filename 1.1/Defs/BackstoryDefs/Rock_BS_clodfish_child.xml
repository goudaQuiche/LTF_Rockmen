	<baseDescription>There is no place for art in Rockman culture with one exception. Born with the rare trait of opposable thumbs [PAWN_nameDef] spent [PAWN_possessive] childhood with the Smooth Skin Clergy learning the stories of [PAWN_possessive] people. More importantly [PAWN_pronoun] learned how to translate that into carvings and with a hammer and a chisel [PAWN_nameDef] set about weaving intricate patterns into [PAWN_possessive] fellow rockmen. Everyday when [PAWN_nameDef] woke up he pray, hands joined, to the Living Mountain and thanked it for [PAWN_possessive] life with trials or pain.</baseDescription>

	<baseDescription>When you are born with more brains than brawn in the Rockmen world you have few options, one of them is the clergy. Running away from the abusive life the Graphite Shield provided [PAWN_objective], [PAWN_nameDef] thought [PAWN_pronoun] had finally escaped the pain, [PAWN_pronoun] was tragically mistaken. To induct [PAWN_objective] the clergy subjected [PAWN_objective] to the eternal waters, a fast flowing river filled with sediments and hallucinogens. [PAWN_nameDef]’S only reprieve from the excruciating continuing agony was the brief visions of the Living Mountains and the Rock Gods that dwelled inside. After a decade of screaming [PAWN_nameDef] emerged from the river as a Smooth Skin.</baseDescription>

	<baseDescription>The core tenant of Rockman culture is strength and [PAWN_nameDef] had it. Inducted into the Graphite Shield two years early [PAWN_nameDef] missed some important lessons the nursery had to teach [PAWN_objective], such as empathy. Rather [PAWN_nameDef] learned that the only way to communicate was strength and the only way to lead was to dominate. When [PAWN_possessive] class neared the trial of leadership [PAWN_nameDef]S teachers noted a lack of anxiousnesses. Asked about [PAWN_possessive] peculiar behaviour [PAWN_nameDef] admitted [PAWN_pronoun] wasn’t worried about whether or not [PAWN_pronoun] would be the leader. Rather [PAWN_pronoun] was deciding which classmates were suitable to serve under [PAWN_objective] and which ones [PAWN_pronoun] would kill.</baseDescription>

	<baseDescription>A little known fact about Rockmen is they are in fact plants, born of the stone seed to burst from the ground. [PAWN_nameDef] however could not burst from the ground like [PAWN_possessive] peers as misfortune struck [PAWN_objective] early, ironically in the form of a boulder. Using all [PAWN_possessive] strength and all the strength from the ground [PAWN_nameDef] just managed to stop the rolling doom from crushing [PAWN_objective]. As birthing is seen as the first trial [PAWN_nameDef] received no help, so [PAWN_pronoun] spent [PAWN_possessive] childhood growing stronger. Slowly and without sleep pushing the boulder off [PAWN_objective]self. When [PAWN_pronoun] finally birthed [PAWN_pronoun] was immensely strong but [PAWN_pronoun] had little intelligence.</baseDescription>
