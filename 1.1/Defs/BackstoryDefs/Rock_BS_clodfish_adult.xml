	<baseDescription>The Dream had led [PAWN_nameDef] to them, the dream of the mountain. They were a mix of rough and smooth skins but all of them were unnaturally shiny. They led [PAWN_objective] to that trail room, the trail of the mountain, and undressed [PAWN_objective]. Standing on that metal grate alone [PAWN_nameDef] wonder what this trail would do to [PAWN_objective], [PAWN_pronoun] was answered by the explosion of steam that came from under [PAWN_pronoun] feet. This was the one trail you were not expected to surmount consciously, only to survive. The pain of steam searing [PAWN_pronoun] skin mercifully knocked him out, in the subsequent dream [PAWN_nameDef] learned the true will of the Mountain and awoke as a Shiny Skin.</baseDescription>

	<baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] was not of the clergy but [PAWN_pronoun] connection with the mountain was undeniable. [PAWN_nameDef] was born far any settlement and so lived on only what the Living Mountain provided him. When [PAWN_pronoun] was finally discovered gnawing on some precious salt ore [PAWN_pronoun] was initially condemned as an unmarked, someone who had accomplished no trails and had no cravings. Yet the clergy found use of [PAWN_objective]. [PAWN_pronoun] continued his lifelong odyssey around the mountain but now caring for the sacred trees and planting the next generation. After years of carefully salting the ground for [PAWN_pronoun] seeds [PAWN_nameDef] struggled to not help the newborns wrestle their ways from the ground.</baseDescription>

	<baseDescription>The only time [PAWN_nameDef] had ever expressed joy was when [PAWN_pronoun] dream of joining the Metoritick Shield was realised. Defending [PAWN_pronoun] people in the infinite expanse of space was an honour only a few were merited and after [PAWN_pronoun] background, [PAWN_pronoun] never thought [PAWN_pronoun] was going to make it. But now [PAWN_pronoun] was here and [PAWN_pronoun] can only watch in pride as the carvings on his arm grow more intricate as enemy ship after enemy ship evaporates under the might of the Metoritick Shield Forceâ€™s might.</baseDescription>

	<baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] had seen the buildings that the humans erected, imgalomations of steel, wood, plastics and metals. Putrid with their lack of connection to their ancestors, their intricate designs a mere facade covering the emptiness in spirit. Other Rockmen builders had been impressed by their marvels but not [PAWN_nameDef], to [PAWN_nameDef] tradition was everything. Besides times were good, the war had provided plenty of building material to pull off his fallen brethren.</baseDescription>

    <titleShort>Traitor</titleShort>
	<baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] had looked upon human wonders and lost all his faith in the way of the Living Mountain. [PAWN_nameDef] questioned why Rockmen worship a mere pile of rocks letting the humans get ahead in fields of science, culture and society. [PAWN_nameDef] questioned why Rockmen continue to bash each other to pieces while graveyards of rockmen ship prove that human coordination is far more power than any rockman gains from constant competition. [PAWN_nameDef] does not regret betraying the rockmen in favour for the Federation, even if that means after his time comes he will be sent to the enturnal crevice to wallow in darkness for the rest of times.</baseDescription>
